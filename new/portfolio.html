		<h3>Tech Genius Delivers Incredible Speech</h3>
		<div class="article">
			<p>Steve Jobs, tech genius who changed how we view modern technology, reminded students yesterday in a speech at Stanford University, “have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.”</p>
			<p>Steve Jobs, a college dropout himself, told to graduates encouraging them to do work that they love. Jobs is famously known for his work as CEO of Apple Inc. and his work in revolutionizing the personal computer industry.</p>
			<p>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work” Jobs reminded the graduates. Though Jobs who faced problems in his career and was fired as CEO of his own company, Apple he still says he never stopped loving the work he did.</p>
			<p>While discussing the devastating job loss he once faced Jobs said, “Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith.” Jobs wanted to remind the students that though something terrible happened he believes that losing his jobs was one of the best things that ever happened to him.</p>
			<p>“The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.” Jobs said this while talking about how after he was fired he went on to cofound Pixar that was later acquired by Apple.</p>
			<p>Jobs discussed his near death experience he once had. Jobs said, “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.” Though Jobs had a short term cancer scare he is fine now and wanted to remind everyone to live every day to the fullest.</p>
			<p>Jobs believed that death is one of life’s greatest inventions. He said, “Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away” Though he was talking about death this quote was very relevant to the graduates leaving their school. Jobs really pushed into the young student’s minds that you need to lead your own life and lead that life to the fullest.</p>
			<p>“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.” Throughout Jobs entire speech he encouraged students to trust in something and follow their hearts. He believed that everything happens for a reason and you have to, “trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.”</p>
			<p>Jobs kept his speech extremely inspirational throughout the entirety and with his conclusion, “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” He urged students to never give up on what they love.</p>

		<h3>Expert Urges Students Start Job Preparation Early</h3>
		<div class="article">
			<p>In today’s competitive job market, you must start early. This was the main point Dan Schawbel, an expert at helping millennials get jobs post college, made in an interview with Susan Adams on Forbes.com.</p>
			<p>Schawbel gave the students a list of 6 things they must do to be able to get their first job after college. With all the advice he gave students including, “The longer you wait, the worse off you are” he urged students more than anything to start early when it comes to career connections.</p>
			<p>In 2012, Schawbel completed a study of 200 students across the country who are looking to get a job straight out of college, this study led to the current advice he gives to students.</p>
			<p>He urges students to create a LinkedIn profile. “Young people should do this as early as their senior year in high school” Schawbel urged students. He insisted that if employers can find you on LinkedIn it looks really good.</p>
			<p>Schawbel also encouraged students to establish a presence on WordPress or through your own blog. He believes that students should, “pick a personal interest and write about that.” He also encouraged students that if they can write about a specific career they are very interested in then that is much more preferable.</p>
			<p>“It’s never too early to start interning” Schawbel stated in the interview. He urged students to, as early as high school, get internships with a company that has wide brand recognition to create meaningful career connections.</p>
			<p>Schawbel also urged students to find a mentor and to be creative while looking for one. He noted, “if you get one mentor it can change everything for you” he recommends using social media such as, LinkedIn to find a mentor in the specific field you want to work in.</p>
			<p>He also wanted to remind students to use their school’s career service office because they can be a very useful resource. They can connect you with school alum in your field of interest along with resume and cover letter help he reminded students.</p>
			<p>The last piece of advice Schawbel gave to students was to, join a professional development or industry-specific group. “These groups can connect you to established professionals in your area of interest. This is a great way to make mentoring connections and to form relationships that are likely to be helpful in the future” he urged students.</p>
			<p>With all the advice Schawbel gave to students he really urged students to start making these connections as early as possible. He insisted, “the old-fashioned idea of spending your time at college exploring intellectual pursuits and putting off entry into the real world of work is no longer relevant” He urges students to be proactive as early as possible and if you haven’t already started, you should start now.</p>
